The main goal of this tutorial is to learn the docker basic concepts from a user perspective and to get familiar with the docker cli.

You will learn about:

  - how docker stores images and manages container data
  - how to run your first container
  - how to run a service in a docker container and make it available outside of Docker
  - how to persist your data
  - how to install and use a docker web interface 
  - how to create (e.g. from a Dockerfile) or modify a docker image and share it using a registry
  - how to setup a basic CI pipeline to automate the image build
